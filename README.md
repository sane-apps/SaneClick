## The Problem

Every time you right-click in Finder, you're stuck with Apple's limited context menu. Want to convert an image? Open in Terminal? Run a quick script? You have to leave Finder, open another app, navigate back to your file, and do it manually.

### Why Can't You Fix It Yourself?

macOS has Services and Folder Actions, but they require Automator knowledge or AppleScript expertise. Most people give up before they start.

### Why Alternatives Fail You

The "easy" solutions cost $10-15, require subscriptions, or haven't been updated since 2019. Some are abandonware. Others are overkill.

## Installation

### Download

[Buy SaneClick](https://saneclick.com) — Signed, notarized, ready to use. Supports sustainable open source development.

### Build from Source

**Building from source?** Consider [buying the app](https://saneclick.com) to support continued development.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sane-apps/SaneClick.git
cd SaneClick

# Build + test (preferred)
./scripts/SaneMaster.rb verify

# Launch
./scripts/SaneMaster.rb launch
```
SaneMaster runs XcodeGen when needed; only run `xcodegen generate` manually if you add files and want to refresh immediately.

### First Launch

On first launch, SaneClick offers curated starter packs by category. Pick the ones that match your workflow and install scripts with one click. Add more anytime from the library.

### Enable the Extension

1. Open SaneClick
2. Go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Extensions > Finder**
3. Enable **SaneClick**

### Troubleshooting

Check extension status in **Settings > General**:
- **Green** = Active and working
- **Orange** = Enabled but Finder needs restart (use the "Restart Finder" button)
- **Red** = Disabled — enable in System Settings

---

## Usage

1. **Add Scripts**: Click the + button and choose "New Script"
2. **Configure**: Set name, type (Bash/AppleScript/Automator), content, icon, and file filters
3. **Test**: Use the Test button to select real files and preview output/errors before saving
4. **Organize**: Create custom categories and assign scripts to groups
5. **Use**: Right-click files in Finder to see your scripts
6. **Notifications**: Toggle action completion confirmations in Settings

### Script Variables

| Type | Variables |
|------|-----------|
| **Bash** | `$1`, `$2`, etc. for file paths, or `$@` for all |
| **AppleScript** | `item 1 of argv` to access paths |
| **Automator** | File paths via standard input |
